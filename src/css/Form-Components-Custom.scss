//Google Dropdown Styling
// pac-container		The visual element containing the list of predictions 
// 						returned by the Place Autocomplete service. This list 
// 						appears as a dropdown list below the Autocomplete or 
// 						SearchBox widget.
// pac-icon				The icon displayed to the left of each item in the 
// 						list of predictions.
// pac-item				An item in the list of predictions supplied by the 
// 						Autocomplete or SearchBox widget.
// pac-item:hover		The item when the user hovers their mouse pointer over it.
// pac-item-selected	The item when the user selects it via the keyboard. 
// 						Note: Selected items will be a member of this class 
// 						and of the pac-item class.
// pac-item-query		A span inside a pac-item that is the main part of the 
// 						prediction. For geographic locations, this contains a 
// 						place name, like 'Sydney', or a street name and number, 
// 						like '10 King Street'. For text-based searches such as 
// 						'pizza in New York', it contains the full text of the query. 
// 						By default, the pac-item-query is colored black. If there 
// 						is any additional text in the pac-item, it is outside 
// 						pac-item-query and inherits its styling from pac-item. 
// 						It is colored gray by default. The additional text is 
// 						typically an address.
// pac-matched			The part of the returned prediction that matches the 
// 						userâ€™s input. By default, this matched text is highlighted 
// 						in bold text. Note that the matched text may be anywhere 
// 						within pac-item. It is not necessarily part of pac-item-query, 
// 						and it could be partly within pac-item-query as well as partly 
// 						in the remaining text in pac-item.
